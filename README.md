Welcome to the Harness Product Manager Changelog! Here at Harness, we believe in radical transperency. We should let our users know about the changes we introduce into the platform, decisions we made with features, and tips to adopt the new capabilities. This repo contains documentation around the changes from our Harness CD 1.0 Product to our Harness CD 2.0 Product. It also includes new changes we have introduced with our CD 2.0 product after its initial launch.
